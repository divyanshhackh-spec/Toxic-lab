# 🌍 Toxic~Lab — AQI Lifespan Impact Calculator  
### Hack Club Flavortown Project (Software Edition)

Toxic~Lab is a health-awareness web application that helps people understand the hidden dangers of air pollution. It converts Air Quality Index (AQI) data into real-life health impact metrics like **cigarette equivalence** and **estimated lifespan reduction**.

This project focuses on spreading awareness about the serious health risks caused by poor air quality.

## 🧠 Overview

The AQI Lifespan Calculator estimates how air pollution exposure can affect human health and life expectancy using real-time AQI data.

Users enter their **age** and **location**, and the system calculates:

- Equivalent cigarettes inhaled due to pollution exposure  
- Potential reduction in lifespan  
- Health risk insights and prevention tips  

---

## ✨ Features

- **🌫 Real-Time AQI Data**  
  Fetches live air pollution data based on user-selected location.

- **🚬 Cigarette Equivalence Model**  
  Converts PM2.5 exposure into the estimated number of cigarettes inhaled per day.

- **⏳ Lifespan Impact Estimation**  
  Estimates years of life potentially reduced due to long-term exposure.

- **📊 Interactive Dashboard**  
  Visual charts, animated indicators, and pollutant breakdown.

- **💡 Health Recommendations**  
  Practical suggestions to reduce pollution exposure.

- **📱 Responsive Design**  
  Works smoothly on both mobile and desktop devices.

## ⚙ How It Works

1. **User Input**  
   Enter age and location (state/city).

2. **AQI Data Fetching**  
   The app retrieves real-time AQI and pollutant data.

3. **Impact Calculation**  
   Pollution exposure is converted into:
   - Cigarette equivalence  
   - Estimated lifespan reduction  

4. **Results Display**  
   The dashboard shows AQI status, health impact, and recommendations.

## 🔬 Scientific Basis (Educational Estimates)

- **Cigarette Equivalence**  
  ~22 µg/m³ PM2.5 ≈ 1 cigarette

- **Lifespan Reduction**  
  Based on Air Quality Life Index (AQLI) research linking PM2.5 exposure to reduced life expectancy.
